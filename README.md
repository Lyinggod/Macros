# Macros
 This is a list of macro for Foundry VTT. Many of these will be specifically for the FFG Star Wars setting or Genesys

 ### Genesys Custom Skill Generator
 Creates a custom skill list from installed skill lists. It allows for easier creation of a custom skill list and prevents accidentally damaging the json structure during editing. The final output will need to be pasted into a text file and imported using the system's native skill import system,

### FFG Display Actor Talents
Shows talents on the actor in a dialog that is searchable and sortable

Players see their registered character. GM's can see may select characters from a dropdown.
